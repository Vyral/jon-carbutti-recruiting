<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Our real estate team is growing.</em></p>

Welcome back to our agent training blog, where we bring you relevant information to increase your business and sell more homes in 2021. Today I want to talk about how our team has been growing and why working with a real estate team is often better than working as a solo agent

We now have a full-time employee, Lisa Holden, whose sole responsibility is to onboard all of our new agents and walk them through the onboarding process. **She has been instrumental with our newest agents,** some of whom (believe it or not) have been among our best agents.

One of our agents just wrote her fourth offer with a client very recently, and she has three sales pending. She has only been licensed for less than four months\!

Another agent, with Lisa’s help, just put his first sale pending together and is taking his first listing along the shoreline with an expired listing. The clients were super impressed with how prepared he was for that presentation and they realized right away that the Carbutti Real Estate Team was right for the job.

The days of being a one-person show in real estate are not necessarily over, but **working alone will put you at a disadvantage, especially if you’re a new agent.** There are clear benefits to working with a team, such as back-end support, resources, and systems to promote success.

If you’re looking for a real estate team to join, have been thinking of starting a career in real estate, or would like to talk about your approach to business and how it can improve, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.
