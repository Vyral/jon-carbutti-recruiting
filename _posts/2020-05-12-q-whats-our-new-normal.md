We’ve made changes to continue helping our clients amid COVID-19.

The last few weeks have been difficult because of the global pandemic and what’s going on in the real estate market. We all wait for the spring market every year, and this time it’s been disrupted. Remarkably, despite that, our team just experienced the busiest April we’ve had in three years, and we haven’t missed a beat. We’re doing some things a bit differently right now in regard to how we’re running our business.

**Our new normal is meeting with clients virtually** **and having them sign documents via DocuSign.** Some may see these changes as negatives, but I see the opposite. I love the way the real estate industry is going with this. Honestly, I want things to stay like this even after the health crisis abates; I enjoy doing everything electronically.&nbsp;

We also have virtual home selling webinars every Thursday evening at 6:30. I can share my screen to show participants what I’m discussing and answer any questions they have.

If any of you are considering a career in real estate, it’s not the time to put your plans on hold. This is the time to get into the real estate market because it’s alive and well.&nbsp;

If you want to talk about your business with me, call or email any time. Also, reach out if you have any questions. I would love to help you.
