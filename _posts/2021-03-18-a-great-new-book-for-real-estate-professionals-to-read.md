Today I want to talk about Ryan Serhant’s brand-new book, “Big Money Energy: How to Rule at Work, Dominate at Life, and Make Millions.”

**For any of you who are not familiar with Ryan, he’s the No. 1 real estate broker in NYC and the star of Bravo’s “Million Dollar Listing: NYC.”** He’s a great, humble, and charitable guy. He did a 30-minute Zoom call with my entire team recently and we were blown away by his generosity and some of the tips he was sharing.

If you haven’t bought this book yet, I have great news. I bought 100 pre-release copies and have 46 of them left. **If you want a copy, reach out to me via phone or email and I’ll get it sent out to you.** It’s not just for real estate salespeople. It’s a great book for entrepreneurs, business owners, and more. It was a great read and super relatable.

If you have any other questions for me about the book or the real estate business in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
