There is a lot of power in having a team. **We highly recommend having an inside sales department working for you and doing a lot of the heavy lifting with lead conversion and follow-up.** It will help you tremendously.&nbsp;

Here at Carbutti Real Estate, we have been growing our inside sales department - we even hired our second full-time inside sales agent (ISA) the day this video was filmed\! We know how to train people quickly and successfully.&nbsp;

Therefore, if you have any questions about how to set up your own inside sales department or what things would look like for your specific business, call or email us. We would love to hear from you.
