Today I’m talking about implementing video into your business strategy. I know some agents have been hesitant to do so. My advice to you would be to get over it. I never wanted to do videos either. I fought it and fought it and I'll be the first one to tell you that it has increased my business threefold. The video is a necessary evil.

You don't necessarily have to have a professional videographer. **Your video doesn't have to be perfect.** You can mess up sometimes, it is going to make you come across as a genuine human. The more you shoot videos, the more comfortable you will get in front of the camera.

Real estate is a sales business built on relationships. I think one of the most beneficial things about doing videos that I didn't realize in the beginning was that **people were feeling like they already knew me with the video.** The videos have done so much for my business. It feels like clients already know you and you feel good knowing that the stories you’ve told on video have helped others.

If you are worried about doing video, get out of your own head and do it. **You'll see great results.** If you need any advice about shooting video, what camera to use, what equipment, or anything at all I'll help you out. I've made a lot of mistakes and I'm still making mistakes. Reach out to me at 203-980-6886 and shoot me a quick text message or email me at [jonathan.carbutti@gmail.com](mailto:jonathan.carbutti@gmail.com). I'd love to sit down with you. I’m always looking to help my fellow agents grow.
