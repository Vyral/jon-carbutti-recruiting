I hope you had a wonderful 2022. We actually had a record-breaking year\! We were the most profitable we've ever been, and we've sold the most homes and helped the most families that we've ever helped. I have a feeling that 2023 will be even better.

This is the time of the year when I always reflect on my business. I take this time of the year to think back on what I did right, what I did wrong, what’s working, and what isn’t working. You should be doing the same.

If you're struggling in real estate right now, or you started in real estate in the last 12 to 18 months, reach out to us. **I'd love to show you everything that we have to offer and the many processes and systems in place that assist with lead generation.**

I would love to show you what an inside sales department could do for your business. Reach out to me at (203) 980-6886 or Jonathan.Carbutti@gmail.com. I've helped many other struggling agents, and I'd love to talk to you about your business.
