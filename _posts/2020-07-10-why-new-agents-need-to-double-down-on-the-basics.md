<p style="text-align:center;"><em>The market is booming—but don’t get complacent, agents.</em></p>

Yes, the market is booming, and yes, houses are flying off the shelves. To some of the newer agents to the business, the real estate industry might almost seem easy—all they have to do is put a house on the market and they can sell it in a day. However, today I want to remind all of you that this is not a typical real estate market.&nbsp;

That’s why **now more than ever, it’s important for agents to get a good handle on the basics** of real estate, including practicing scripts and dialogues, protecting your time, getting into a schedule, and learning the business.

When the market changes from being such a hot seller’s market to more of a buyer’s market where houses sit on the market for a lot longer than they are now, you’ll have to use different strategies to get the homes sold. That’s when your experience and your reference points are truly going to matter. The experienced agents who embrace consistency and protect their time are going to be the ones who thrive when the market changes.

I have brand-new agents who are crushing it right now. One of my agents who was licensed in February already has five sales under his belt. Part of the reason that he’s doing so well is that he has access to great mentoring and coaching; **if you’re new to the industry, you need to find a broker that fits your values** and is willing to provide the support and coaching you need.

If you’d like to discuss your strategies and business plan or you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.
