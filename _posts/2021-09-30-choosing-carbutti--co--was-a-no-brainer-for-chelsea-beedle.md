Chelsea Beedle chose a career in real estate because she required more flexibility with a four-year-old and a nine-month-old at home. Chelsea was driven to real estate because she likes to talk, she connects with people well, and has a strong customer service background.&nbsp;

**Here’s what she had to say about her decision to join our team:**

*“When I was interviewing agencies, I knew right off the bat that Carbutti was who I wanted to sign with. Before even walking out the door, I had a feeling of team and family. I felt like I could trust them, and this is exactly what I wanted to do. I was actually surprised with how many of the opportunities, client opportunities, lead generation, and valuable resources that I could use.”&nbsp;*

**Her advice for agents who are weighing their options:**

*“Really interview the firm that you’re working for, find out the benefits, and remember that commission doesn't always matter. You want somebody there that cares for you, that has your back and has resources available to you. I’m from New Haven County, and it’s very refreshing and feels good to help people find their dream homes. I’m building my community up, I love living here, and it’s great. Although I’ve only had my license for two months, I have three sales pending and will have a fourth by the end of the week.”*

If you have any questions about our team, what it’s like working with us, or anything else related to the real estate business, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
