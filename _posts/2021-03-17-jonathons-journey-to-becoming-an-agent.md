*Here’s new agent Jonathon’s journey into real estate in his own words.*

My name is Jonathon Corriveau, and I chose a career in real estate because my daughter was an infant, so I wanted a career that would allow me to support her and make money working for myself and not someone else. I had a retail background; I worked at Best Buy and Firestone, and I was selling people plenty of things they didn’t need. **I was a good salesman, but I wanted to sell people things they truly needed**, so I thought real estate would be the right career for me. There are many naysayers when you try to get into a career in real estate, but what was crucial for me was finding that one person who told me to go for it, and I stayed around that person.

I received a call from Andrew, the sales manager at Carbutti and Co., and he wanted to sit down for an interview with me. We sat down for about two hours and discussed many topics at length, both about real estate and other matters. **The atmosphere is what drew me to this team.** The day I got licensed, I went home and proposed to my girlfriend, who is now my fiancée, so it was one of the best days of my life.

Next, Andrew and Lisa, the vice president, helped me set fantastic goals that I want to knock out of the park. My personal goal is to ensure the health and welfare of my daughter and unborn son. My main professional goal is to be a respected agent in my brokerage and to my clients.

If you have any questions about real estate or our team, please call or email us. We would love to speak with you.
