Welcome back to our agent training blog. We’re in the middle of the spring market, and I’m out today making my rounds on our pendings. I like to get out there with my boots on the ground and see what’s going on to keep myself informed about the marketplace.

As I was putting up some ‘sale pending’ signs for my team members, I got to thinking about where my agents are getting a lot of their business. One of my team members is getting 70% of their business from our brokerage, marketing, and advertising.

**If you’re a one-person show right now and doing everything by yourself and you’re having challenges, I’d love to talk to you.** Our team has been growing, and our agents' production has been growing too. Our advertising and marketing are paying off in a big way, and we have more leads than we can handle.

If you're interested in finding what we have to offer or how you can get in on some of this company-generated business, give me a call today. I’d love to talk to you about your business and show you what we have to offer, whether you’re a seasoned agent or a brand-new one. I look forward to hearing from you.
