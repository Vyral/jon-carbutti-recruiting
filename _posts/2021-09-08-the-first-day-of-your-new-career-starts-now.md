Today, I want to remind everyone about our next real estate career night. **It will be held on Thursday, September 16 at 6:00 p.m. at 707 Main Street, Branford, CT.** &nbsp;If you have ever considered a career in real estate, I highly recommend you come to our event. We will answer all your real estate questions and get you started on an exciting new career path.&nbsp;

Currently, real estate is a level playing field. Some of our newer agents have been our top sellers. A 27-year old agent joined our team in January; they already have 23 sales. I’m not saying the business is easy, but if you do the work the right way, the opportunities are out there.&nbsp;

**If you are at all interested, please head over to**[**www.meetcarbutti.com**](http://www.meetcarbutti.com) **and reserve your spot.** I look forward to seeing you there\!
