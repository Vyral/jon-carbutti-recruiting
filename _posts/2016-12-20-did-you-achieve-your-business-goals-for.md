We had a record-breaking year for 2016, and we’re looking for people who want to be a part of a high-producing team to join us in 2017.

I hope you have accomplished your sales goals for the year. Here at Carbutti & Co Realtors, we had a record-breaking year for 2016. We actually had our highest volume of sales ever.

With that in mind, I’m hoping that anybody who is looking for a buyer’s agent or listing specialist position, or simply wants to be a part of a high-producing team could reach out to us in 2017. We have a well-oiled machine here, and we’re setting appointments on a daily and weekly basis.

We’re looking for qualified agents who can instill confidence, transmit strength to their clients, and actually want to go on pre-approved appointments and sell some houses rather than chase shiny pennies.

Let us do the heavy lifting for you. If you’re looking to be a part of a team, call me or shoot me a quick email. I’d love to set up a confidential interview and help you reach your sales goals for 2017.

Happy holidays, and have a safe New Year. I’d love to talk to you soon!
