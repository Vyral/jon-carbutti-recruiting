If you’re anything like me, you may be overwhelmed by the number of apps and social media options available today. Obviously we’re all aware of Facebook, as it’s the most-used social media network, but Instagram has over 400 million users and Twitter has over 320 million users. Because Facebook users dwarf those numbers, you might be surprised to learn that both Twitter and Instagram are outperforming Facebook in usage.

If you’re not familiar with how to promote your team and your business through these two social media platforms, there are a ton of resources out there for you to look into. I highly recommend creating both a Twitter and an Instagram account in order to broaden your reach and get in front of more people.

Another newer service is Snapchat. You may have heard of it due to its popularity among younger people, but there are some statistics I recently came across that blew my mind. There are about 100 million users on it, and right now, Snapchat ads are seen anywhere between 500,000 and one million times a day. What’s interesting about these ads is you know they are being viewed because people have to click on them when they appear if they want to view the next snap.

If you’re not getting involved with these apps now on the ground floor, you’re really missing out. I’m going to be doing some really interesting things with Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter, and I would like to see what you’re doing as well. If you would like to collaborate or if you have any questions about what we’re going to be doing, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would love to strategize with you!
