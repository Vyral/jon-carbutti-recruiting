There’s power in having a strong real estate team behind you. I’m not talking about buyers and sellers—I’m talking about real estate agents.&nbsp;**The days of being a one-person show are over in this business**, and there is great power in leveraging yourself behind an experienced real estate team to become successful.

Chelsea Beedle knew right off the bat that she wanted to sign with us before walking out the door. She felt like family to us, and she knew that she could trust us in return.

Another agent, Chris Farrell, was most impressed by our tools. From the mid-level and social media managers to more experienced agents helping newer agents, it’s a support system he has never encountered before.

Sean Doran liked the access to leadership, training, lead generation, and marketing. There’s nothing like this that he’s seen from any other local company.

If being a part of a real estate team feels right for you, **join us for our next Carbutti Career Night on Thursday, May 12, at 6:00 p.m. at our office (707 Main Street, Branford, CT).**&nbsp;
