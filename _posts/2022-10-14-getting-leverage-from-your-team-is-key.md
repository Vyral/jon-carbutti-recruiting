Today I want to talk about how good we have it and being grateful for what we have. Many people are wary of being on a team, or they hear about real estate teams and say, “Oh my God, those splits will never work for me. I deserve more, and I should have a higher split.”

However, I think a lot of agents don’t understand the power of leverage with a team. It’s not about the splits. **It’s about the number of transactions and doing more business while spending less of your time, money, and resources**—all while maintaining a good work-life balance.

That’s what this real estate business is all about. It’s about making money, having success, and supporting our families, but also living the life you want to live.

I was having a conversation with a team member this morning about our splits. He said his friend down in Florida has a team, and when he told me what their splits are, I realized **I’m paying almost double what the Florida broker is paying his team**. My guys are making a ton of money on their splits right now.

The point I’m trying to make today is that it doesn’t matter what your splits are. What matters is how much business you’re doing and how much leverage you’re getting from your team, the company, and the broker you’re working for.&nbsp;

If you want to learn more about our team or want to learn more about working on a team in general, shoot me an email or give me a call at (203)-980-6886. I’d love to help\!&nbsp;&nbsp;
