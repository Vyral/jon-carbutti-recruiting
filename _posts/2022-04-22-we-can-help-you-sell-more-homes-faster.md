I’ve always said that agents can do more together than we can individually. That’s not to say that agents can’t be successful by themselves, but the added support, training, and resources that a team provides are powerful assets on the path to success. If you’re looking to take your business to the next level and would benefit from a team environment, **Carbutti & Co Realtors are hiring\!**

Our team went from $11 million in closed production for Q1 of last year to over $24 million closed in Q1 of this year. That increase is a testament to the power of our team dynamic.

In just the last 30 days, I’ve had four experienced real estate agents reach out to us to join our team. In their first 20 days with us, they already put over $2 million under contract. Those new agents found out that working on a team provides a lot more leverage than working alone.

If you’re interested in learning more about what life on our team is like and how we train our agents to sell more homes in less time, give me a call or send me an email. Let’s have a confidential conversation about your business and how we can help you grow it.
