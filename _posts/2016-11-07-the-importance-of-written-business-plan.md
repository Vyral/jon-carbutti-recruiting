Looking to improve your real estate career? I'm here to help you make a smart
decision when it comes to growing your business, improving your bottom
line, and choosing a place to work in real estate sales. If you'd like
to learn more about working with Carbutti & Co. Realtors, contact me
 at (203) 269-4910 or Jonathan@Carbutti.com.

It’s now the first week of November, and with the election coming to an end in a couple of days, we’ll soon be able to get back to business.


One of the most important things you should be doing right now is planning your business for 2017. Yes, it’s still 2016 and you’re still putting deals together. There may be more commissions to be had in December, but you should be doing your business planning now. What worked for you in 2016? Where did most of your business come from? Go through every closed transaction from the both seller and buyer side to find out exactly where that business came from. You can eliminate the poorest performing advertising marketing strategies are, to eliminate them from the budget of 2017.
