Welcome back to our agent training blog. We're excited to continue bringing you relevant information to sell more homes and make 2021 one of the best years that you've had yet. To the newer agents out there that are interviewing real estate brokers, I offer this piece of advice: Don't overlook the independent,&nbsp; family-owned real estate companies like Carbutti Real Estate.

**Our agents are thriving.** The new agents in this marketplace have such a level playing field these days. Some of our newer agents are actually our best agents. We have a 26-year-old agent who joined my team in January and has 23 sales already. Another agent who joined us two months ago has three pending sales and they're working on their fourth right now, which will be under contract by the end of this week.

There's a misconception out there that when you're getting into real estate and interviewing real estate brokers, that you need to find a big-name team. It’s just not true. **Our team has leads, seller and buyer opportunities on a daily basis for our agents, and excellent support staff.**

If you're thinking about a career in real estate or you're looking for a great real estate brokerage to interview with, call us directly at 203-980-6886 or go to [carbuttirealestate.com](https://www.carbuttirealestate.com/)and we’ll get back to you quickly.
