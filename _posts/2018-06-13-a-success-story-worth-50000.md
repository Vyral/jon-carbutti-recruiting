Get stories like this under your belt so can start telling them and show your future clients your past successes.

What makes me really proud to be in the real estate industry? Success stories like the one I am going to share with you today.

{% include pullquote.html %}

Consultative approaches can be a great thing. When clients listen, everybody wins.

My client is 74 years old and has owned his home for 36 years. Recently, he had a neighbor approach him about purchasing the home for $190,000. He considered the offer and actually almost sold his home to the neighbor.

However, he met with our real estate team and we went through the home with him. We told him that he could sell it for that amount, but if he cleaned it out, painted it, and refinished the hardwood floors, he would get a lot more money.

The client decided to listen to us. He had the place professionally cleaned and refinished the floors. It may have been a lot of work moving out the nine dumpstersâ€™ worth of stuff from the upstairs, but within 48 hours we had 25 showings and were in a five-offer multiple offer situation. We ended up getting him $50,000 more than what the neighbor was offering.

Get stories like this under your belt so you can start telling the stories, or have old clients tell your story to show future clients your success. There is nothing more powerful than social proof.

If you are not using video or professional photography with the latest and greatest marketing, contact me by phone or email. I would be happy to speak with you about moving from being an amateur to a professional. It is time for you to go pro.
