Today we are excited to share an interview with one of our beloved agents, Sanja Joksovic! She used to be a family therapist but decided to go into real estate and has loved it. **She has always enjoyed working with and helping people and saw real estate as a perfect fit.&nbsp;**

The first time she heard about Carbutti Realtors was on the radio. She then decided to go to one of our career nights, met a lot of great people, and decided that this was the place she needed to be.&nbsp;

When she started working with us, she was surprised there was so much support and training. She loved the culture and could see that everyone wanted to help each other, which was very important to her as a new agent.&nbsp;

**Her goal is to sell 30 houses this year**, and she’s grateful that this team can hold her accountable and show her what she needs to do to make that happen. If you want more information or to reach out to Sanja, don’t hesitate to call or email us! We would be happy to put you in touch with her and help in any way we can.
