At Carbutti & Co. Real Estate, our goal for 2019 is to help agents work smarter—not harder.
A lot of agents understand the difference between dollar-producing and non dollar-producing activities,
but correctly allocating one’s focus between these two kinds of tasks can be easier said than done.
That’s why we offer full-time real estate coaching for new agents. We want to take those just entering
the business and help get them into production as soon as possible. So if you’re interested in being a
part of our mentorship program, get in touch with us. To learn more about this opportunity, watch this
short video.
