If you’ve ever been curious about what being a part of Carbutti Real Estate is like, today’s your chance to hear it straight from one of our agents.

We could go on and on about the reasons agents love being a part of our team here at Carbutti Real Estate, but we think it’s best to let them tell you in their own words. That why for today’s message, we brought on agent Devin Close to talk about her experience with us. Devin came to us as a recent college graduate, and when she learned more about what we’re all about, she knew that coming aboard with us was “a no-brainer.” Aside from the assistance we offer all of our new agents, Devin said one of the things she appreciates most about working for Carbutti Real Estate is that she didn’t have to drain her own bank account just to get off the ground and start making money. That's because, compared to other brokerages, the fees we charge are very minimal. From the opportunities and resources we offer, Devin feels secure in her ability to pursue her personal and professional goals. As always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
