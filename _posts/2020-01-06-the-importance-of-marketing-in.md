A career in the real estate business is also a career in the marketing business. Here’s why.

We’re almost into 2020, but before we get there, I have a message for you. Everybody wants to get into the real estate business, but if you’re getting into the real estate business right now, you’re actually getting into the marketing business as well.

Right now, when you’re thinking about a career in real estate, you’re entering one of the most competitive businesses out there. This means that you don’t want to look like everyone else.
You want to stand out from the crowd. The best way to stand out is through your marketing. Whether it’s through radio, TV, advertising, social media, you have got to look different than every other agent and you’ve got to make an impression.
