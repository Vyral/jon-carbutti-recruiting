In order to take your career in real estate to the next level, you need to stay in a routine. It’s a simple concept, but as someone who has been in real estate for 22 years, **one common thread among successful agents is accountability.&nbsp;**

Here at Carbutti & Co., we really put a focus on achieving things together. It’s not just about one agent doing their own thing, although you can have success as an individual agent. However, **there’s a certain power to working on a team in terms of mindshare, resources, and the power of controlling the saleable inventory.**

Everyone on our team understands their role. We have an inside sales department, a full-time social media manager, professional photographers, and more.&nbsp;

Real estate is all about dollar-producing activities and non dollar-producing activities. I believe **we’ve done a great job of training our agents on those dollar-producing activities and how best to execute them.**

If you have any questions for me about what we do, or if you're interested in bringing your real estate career to the next level, don’t hesitate to reach out by giving me a call or sending an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
