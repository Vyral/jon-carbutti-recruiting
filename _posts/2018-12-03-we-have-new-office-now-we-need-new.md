I am pleased to announce the opening of the 2nd Carbutti Realtors office
right here in downtown Branford, CT. (707 Main St.) and a short walk from
the town green. We’re beautifully renovating a great first-floor space to make
this an office of the future for the agents here along the shoreline.
We will be open for business as of December 1.


Right now, we’re looking for five to 10 brand-new team members to
join us. If you’re interested in increasing your business in 2019 and learning
a new, different, and more productive way of doing real estate, give me a call
or send me an email today so we can set up a confidential interview.

If you have any other questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
