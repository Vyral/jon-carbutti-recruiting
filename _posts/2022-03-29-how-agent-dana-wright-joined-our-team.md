Today we sat down with one of our agents, Dana Wright, to learn about how she first got into the real estate business and what she loves about working with Carbutti & Co Realtors.

Before she joined the real estate industry, Dana worked for the family business for years. Then she decided she wanted to move on to something different. Real estate seemed like a nice career to switch over to, so she went to school and got her real estate license.

During the process, she saw an opportunity on Facebook: a career night at Carbutti & Co Realtors. **She loved the family-owned feel of our agency. H**aving been a part of a family business, the support and enthusiasm of the staff really drew her in.

The change was surprising for Dana in many ways. She is her own boss, and she sets her own schedule. With our staff’s support, she can focus on following through with company leads and hosting open houses to generate new leads. There’s a lot of running around involved, but it’s rewarding, especially when she gets a client who is fun to work with.

Over the next 12 months, Dana’s professional goal is to help 12 families get into a home they love or move from a home they no longer need. **Her personal goal is to find the time to go on a nice beach vacation.**

If you have any questions about buying or selling a home or the real estate market in general, don’t hesitate to reach out to us by phone or email. One of our great associates like Dana would love to have a conversation with you.
