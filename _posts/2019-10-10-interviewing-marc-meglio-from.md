We point many of our buyer clients in the direction of local lender Marc Meglio with HomeBridge Financial Services. Today you’ll find out why.

Today I’d like to introduce you to one of the premier mortgage lenders in our area: Marc Meglio with HomeBridge Financial Services. We could give you a list of reasons why you should work with him, but we’ll let him tell you in his own words. What makes HomeBridge a cut above other lenders is they specialize in renovation financing on top of the traditional mortgage products. As he puts it, “I, myself, am different...because I go to a lot of open houses with Carbutti & Co. Realtors...and they really appreciate that.” That’s not the only way Marc goes the extra mile: He’s present for all his clients’ closings as well. Because there are a lot of first-time buyers out there who might be nervous entering the process, he takes his role very seriously and looks to establish trust, confidence, and rapport. The team environment we foster also “creates an environment of success,” Marc says. We couldn’t agree more. If you have any questions for us or Marc or you need help with your home buying needs, please let Carbutti & Co. Realtors know. We’d be happy to help!
