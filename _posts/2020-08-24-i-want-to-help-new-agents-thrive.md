If you’re a brand-new agent or have been considering a career in real estate, today I’m speaking directly to you. Our team has been growing—we just recently hired a new vice president of business development and agent training for support. We’re doing a lot of exciting things here at the Jonathan Carbutti Real Estate Group. Whether you’re new or an established agent who is struggling with business consistency, I would love to have an honest conversation about what strategies are (and aren’t) working for you and ways that we can help you balance your work and life. Don’t hesitate to reach out to me if you’d like to have this discussion. I’d be glad to lend you my expertise so that your business can thrive.
