Chris Farrell is one of our newer agents. Here’s what he had to say about his experience working with Carbutti & Co Realtors:

My background is in digital media, marketing, and the school system. After working in all these different fields, I realized that cubicle life was not for me. I believe that getting started in real estate is a lot like going to the gym for the first time. You walk in and see lots of people with progress and results, and you think you can just start creating tremendous numbers yourself. That's not the case. You need to ask for help and take your time. Start walking on the treadmill before you sprint because if you don’t, you'll trip and get upset at the lack of results. Ask for help from your brokerage, your peers, and the veterans in your industry. **You’ll progress quickly if you have patience.**

When I first started real estate, I was terrified that I would be going door to door asking to sell their house. It isn’t that at all. **The tools that we have here at Carbutti & Co. are amazing.** We also have a great support system. You get help and advice from mid-level managers, social media managers, and experienced agents. Carbutti & Co. doesn’t have a corporate atmosphere with tons of red tape. The atmosphere is personal, down-to-earth, and professional, and that really sets them apart from all the other brokerages I've interviewed.

If you have any questions or would like to know more about our job openings, feel free to reach out to us via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
