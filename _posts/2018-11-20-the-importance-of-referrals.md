Today we'll be discussing the best technique for getting referrals

Today, I wanted to speak to some of the newer agents in the marketplace about the importance of referrals. The house behind me is actually the fourth referral that I’ve received from the same past client in the last 12 months. The reason I’m bringing this up is that I’ve seen many real estate gurus encourage new agents to buy internet leads or reach out to cold contacts. What I’ve found is most effective, however, is to cultivate your sphere of influence. Creating raving fans is what will allow you to get multiple referrals from the same past clients.

If you want to know how to cultivate your sphere of influence, please give me a call or send me an email. We’re opening our second office on December 1, 2018, and we’d love for you to join our team.
