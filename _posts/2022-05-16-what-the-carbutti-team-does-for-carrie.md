What does the Carbutti Team offer our agents? Today we want to share a testimonial from Carrie Vass Brainerd about her experience with the team so far.&nbsp;

Carrie got her start in real estate in 2003 as an admin. She loved getting to know the ins and outs of the business, but eventually, she switched to the REO department to work with foreclosures. It was an entirely different ballgame, but she loved everything about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

After working there for a few years, she figured she was ready to get her license and go out on her own. She had known about Carbutti Real Estate for a while, but **she was still surprised by everything the team offered.** Even now, she’s surprised by the amount of support she receives. Instead of being stuck in paperwork, she can focus on getting more transactions.&nbsp;

Carrie has worked as a solo agent before, and it was fine. She knew what she was doing and made ends meet. However, after joining the Carbutti team, she sees the industry in an entirely different light. According to her, **you might be able to do everything yourself, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you should.** All the time the Carbutti Team saves her allows her to get out and make more money.&nbsp;

We also encourage our agents to put themselves out there on social media, and Carrie really appreciates that. A lot of people are afraid to shoot videos or make posts, but **it’s been a very positive experience for her.** People she doesn’t even know reach out to her because they saw a video, and it’s taken her business to the next level.&nbsp;

If you have questions for Carrie about her experience or anything else, please call or email us. We are always willing to talk\!
