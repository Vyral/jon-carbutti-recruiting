If you want to sell more homes this year, then I recommend checking out a great audiobook called “Fanatical Prospecting” by Jeb Blount.

I hope your 2017 is off to a great start and that you are on your way to selling more homes. To keep your momentum going, I recommend that you check out this great audiobook, “Fanatical Prospecting” by Jeb Blount.

I have listened to this audiobook four times and each time, I’ve learned something new from it.

The brutal fact is that most real estate agents and salespeople fail because they don’t feed the front end of their pipeline. You won’t have enough deals if you don’t have enough leads or prospects.

This audiobook will give you some real time tips on things you can implement in your business to convert more leads. They have a great 30-day rule, which is critical to keeping your pipeline full. Blount also discusses the Five C’s of Social Selling, how to get prospects to call you, and his five-step text messaging formula.

I’ve been implementing some of these things and I have already gotten responses back. If any of you want to borrow my copy, I would be happy to loan it to you. Otherwise, check out “Financial Prospecting” on Amazon. I can’t recommend it enough.

If there is anything else I can help you with, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.
