Be sure to leverage the power of video and social media to your advantage.

You aren’t in the real estate business—you’re in the people business. That’s something that many real estate agents need to be reminded of. As agents, we’re also in the branding and marketing business.

In 2020, the real estate industry is also all about creating a fanbase. We live in the age of social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, which gives you many different avenues to help increase your fanbase. Regardless of the platform, **you need to have a consistent strategy for your branding.**

Video is also key, and luckily, videos are simpler than ever to make. We have team members who are finally beginning to dip their toes in the waters of using video as part of their branding and overall strategy, and **they’ve seen amazing results**.

I would love to sit down and have a conversation with you about your business and show you some of our branding strategies that are so easy to implement. Give us a call or send an email, or else we could schedule a video call via Zoom. I hope to hear from you soon.
