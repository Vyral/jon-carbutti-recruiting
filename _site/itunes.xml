A career in the real estate business is also a career in the marketing business. Here’s why.

We’re almost into 2020, but before we get there, I have a message for you. Everybody wants to get into the real estate business, but if you’re getting into the real estate business right now, you’re actually getting into the marketing business as well.

Right now, when you’re thinking about a career in real estate, you’re entering one of the most competitive businesses out there. This means that you don’t want to look like everyone else.
You want to stand out from the crowd. The best way to stand out is through your marketing. Whether it’s through radio, TV, advertising, social media, you have got to look different than every other agent and you’ve got to make an impression.

“You want to stand out from the crowd in this business.”

Here at Carbutti and Co., we’re committed to having a social media manager, along with different marketing strategies and value propositions. If you’re thinking about a career in real estate and you don’t want to go it alone, give us a call or send us an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

We point many of our buyer clients in the direction of local lender Marc Meglio with HomeBridge Financial Services. Today you’ll find out why.

Today I’d like to introduce you to one of the premier mortgage lenders in our area: Marc Meglio with HomeBridge Financial Services. We could give you a list of reasons why you should work with him, but we’ll let him tell you in his own words. What makes HomeBridge a cut above other lenders is they specialize in renovation financing on top of the traditional mortgage products. As he puts it, “I, myself, am different…because I go to a lot of open houses with Carbutti &amp; Co. Realtors…and they really appreciate that.” That’s not the only way Marc goes the extra mile: He’s present for all his clients’ closings as well. Because there are a lot of first-time buyers out there who might be nervous entering the process, he takes his role very seriously and looks to establish trust, confidence, and rapport. The team environment we foster also “creates an environment of success,” Marc says. We couldn’t agree more. If you have any questions for us or Marc or you need help with your home buying needs, please let Carbutti &amp; Co. Realtors know. We’d be happy to help!

        <description>

If you’ve ever been curious about what being a part of Carbutti Real Estate is like, today’s your chance to hear it straight from one of our agents.

We could go on and on about the reasons agents love being a part of our team here at Carbutti Real Estate, but we think it’s best to let them tell you in their own words. That why for today’s message, we brought on agent Devin Close to talk about her experience with us. Devin came to us as a recent college graduate, and when she learned more about what we’re all about, she knew that coming aboard with us was “a no-brainer.” Aside from the assistance we offer all of our new agents, Devin said one of the things she appreciates most about working for Carbutti Real Estate is that she didn’t have to drain her own bank account just to get off the ground and start making money. That’s because, compared to other brokerages, the fees we charge are very minimal. From the opportunities and resources we offer, Devin feels secure in her ability to pursue her personal and professional goals. As always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

At Carbutti &amp; Co. Real Estate, our goal for 2019 is to help agents work smarter—not harder.

the business and help get them into production as soon as possible. So if you’re interested in being a

Today we’ll be discussing the best technique for getting referrals

Today, I wanted to speak to some of the newer agents in the marketplace about the importance of referrals. The house behind me is actually the fourth referral that I’ve received from the same past client in the last 12 months. The reason I’m bringing this up is that I’ve seen many real estate gurus encourage new agents to buy internet leads or reach out to cold contacts. What I’ve found is most effective, however, is to cultivate your sphere of influence. Creating raving fans is what will allow you to get multiple referrals from the same past clients.

If you want to know how to cultivate your sphere of influence, please give me a call or send me an email. We’re opening our second office on December 1, 2018, and we’d love for you to join our team.

Get stories like this under your belt so can start telling them and show your future clients your past successes.

What makes me really proud to be in the real estate industry? Success stories like the one I am going to share with you today.

“GET STORIES LIKE THIS UNDER YOUR BELT SO CAN START TELLING THEM AND SHOW YOUR FUTURE CLIENTS YOUR PAST SUCCESSES.”

Consultative approaches can be a great thing. When clients listen, everybody wins.

My client is 74 years old and has owned his home for 36 years. Recently, he had a neighbor approach him about purchasing the home for $190,000. He considered the offer and actually almost sold his home to the neighbor.

However, he met with our real estate team and we went through the home with him. We told him that he could sell it for that amount, but if he cleaned it out, painted it, and refinished the hardwood floors, he would get a lot more money.

The client decided to listen to us. He had the place professionally cleaned and refinished the floors. It may have been a lot of work moving out the nine dumpsters’ worth of stuff from the upstairs, but within 48 hours we had 25 showings and were in a five-offer multiple offer situation. We ended up getting him $50,000 more than what the neighbor was offering.

Get stories like this under your belt so you can start telling the stories, or have old clients tell your story to show future clients your success. There is nothing more powerful than social proof.

If you are not using video or professional photography with the latest and greatest marketing, contact me by phone or email. I would be happy to speak with you about moving from being an amateur to a professional. It is time for you to go pro.

        <title>The Value of Reading The Resilience Roadmap by Danny Morel </title>

“The Resilience Roadmap” by Danny Morel is a book that can help you reach the level of success you desire.

If you’ve never heard of or haven’t read the book “The Resilience Roadmap” by Danny Morel, I highly recommend that you read it.

I don’t think there’s another real estate agent or broker in the business who’s gone through more trials and tribulations than Danny to get where he is today. I also think there’s not another person who’s more involved on a daily basis in his agents’ success.

“YOUR SUCCESS IS BASED ON YOUR ROUTINE.”

“The Resilience Roadmap” challenges you look at your mindset and your daily activity and make a routine for success. What he argues (and I agree with) is your success is based on your routine. If you don’t have a daily routine of doing the exact same things every day, practicing your skill sets, and getting better every day, you won’t reach the level of success you’re looking for.

I’d love to hear your thoughts on this book, so feel free to text me or send me an email about it. If you have any other questions, I invite you to reach out to me as well. I look forward to hearing from you.

As we wrap up 2017 and look toward 2018, I want to thank you for allowing me to share my experience and knowledge with you

I have a short holiday message to share with you as we end 2017 and look toward 2018.

I appreciate all the emails and private messages of everyone who’s been watching our video blog all year long and asking questions and advice. I enjoy sharing the knowledge and experience I have in real estate and coaching and mentoring newer agents, whether you work for my company or somewhere else.

Remember that 2018 will be a record year for real estate, so make sure you have your systems, processes, and leverage in place.

“2018 WILL BE A RECORD YEAR FOR REAL ESTATE.”

As always, if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. In the meantime, happy holidays and have a happy New Year!

Some really great real estate coaching is available for agents at every level of their careers. The key to getting the most from coaching is figuring out exactly where you are in your career and exactly where you want to be before committing to anyone.

The real estate coaching business is a billion-dollar industry and there are all types of coaches. There are so many different levels of great coaches as well, whether you’re a brand-new agent, an experienced agent stuck at a certain level of production, or you are selling 30 to 40 homes a year and you want to create your own team and leverage yourself to sell more than 100 homes a year.

I’ve coached with the “Red Hot Rookie” through Leader’s Edge, I’ve coached through Carla Cross and “On Track to Success in 30 Days System for Inexperienced Agents,” and I have all the CDs from Dirk Zeller’s Real Estate Champions. The list goes on and on.

Before you choose a coaching program, you need to figure out exactly where you are in your real estate career and what you want to accomplish. You can have a real estate coach or even a prospecting coach. A prospecting coach will teach you what to say, how to say it, and the language behind the sales.

The point is, before you jump in and commit to a six-month or one-year contract with a coach and pay out all this money, figure out exactly what you want to accomplish. I guarantee that if you figure out what your goals are, you can then find the right coach for you.

“HAVE A CLEAR PICTURE OF YOUR GOALS BEFORE SIGNING A CONTRACT WITH A COACH.”

Sometimes paying a coach isn’t even the right answer. It could be a matter of finding the right real estate broker, team leader, or broker-mentor. I like to think of myself as a broker-mentor to my team.

If you’d like to sit down to talk about your goals and what the next level is for you, I’d be happy to sit down with you, because no one’s made more mistakes than I have! No one has spent more money on things that didn’t work and coaching that didn’t work than me.

It all starts with figuring out your goals, then figuring out your level of commitment to the coaching. If you don’t have that level of commitment to do everything your coach asks you to do in a timely manner, then I guarantee you that the coaching won’t work.

If this is a conversation you’d like to have, give me a call or shoot me an email today. I’d love to hear from you!

        <description>

If you want to sell more homes this year, then I recommend checking out a great audiobook called “Fanatical Prospecting” by Jeb Blount.

I hope your 2017 is off to a great start and that you are on your way to selling more homes. To keep your momentum going, I recommend that you check out this great audiobook, “Fanatical Prospecting” by Jeb Blount.

I have listened to this audiobook four times and each time, I’ve learned something new from it.

The brutal fact is that most real estate agents and salespeople fail because they don’t feed the front end of their pipeline. You won’t have enough deals if you don’t have enough leads or prospects.

This audiobook will give you some real time tips on things you can implement in your business to convert more leads. They have a great 30-day rule, which is critical to keeping your pipeline full. Blount also discusses the Five C’s of Social Selling, how to get prospects to call you, and his five-step text messaging formula.

I’ve been implementing some of these things and I have already gotten responses back. If any of you want to borrow my copy, I would be happy to loan it to you. Otherwise, check out “Financial Prospecting” on Amazon. I can’t recommend it enough.

If there is anything else I can help you with, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

We had a record-breaking year for 2016, and we’re looking for people who want to be a part of a high-producing team to join us in 2017.

I hope you have accomplished your sales goals for the year. Here at Carbutti &amp; Co Realtors, we had a record-breaking year for 2016. We actually had our highest volume of sales ever.

With that in mind, I’m hoping that anybody who is looking for a buyer’s agent or listing specialist position, or simply wants to be a part of a high-producing team could reach out to us in 2017. We have a well-oiled machine here, and we’re setting appointments on a daily and weekly basis.

We’re looking for qualified agents who can instill confidence, transmit strength to their clients, and actually want to go on pre-approved appointments and sell some houses rather than chase shiny pennies.

Let us do the heavy lifting for you. If you’re looking to be a part of a team, call me or shoot me a quick email. I’d love to set up a confidential interview and help you reach your sales goals for 2017.

Happy holidays, and have a safe New Year. I’d love to talk to you soon!

It’s not too late to get your real estate license, and we can help finally make it happen for you.

Have you ever thought about getting into the real estate profession but didn’t know where to start? I have good news for you.

We’re offering a brand-new, 60-hour principles and practice class in affiliation with a real estate school out of Middletown that’s starting soon. You could be licensed in as little as 12 to 13 weeks.

Apart from that, I’d love to sit down with anybody who thinks they would be perfect for the real estate profession. I want to talk openly and honestly about real estate as a career and treating it as a business. This is because a lot of people tend to look at real state as a part-time business instead of a full-time career.

“THERE’S NO ‘RIGHT WAY’ TO DO REAL ESTATE, BUT THERE IS A WRONG WAY.”

I can assure you that the business can be extremely lucrative and rewarding if you do it the right way. There’s not necessarily a ‘right way’ to do real estate, but there is most definitely a wrong way. I want to discuss with you the right way to do real estate and the right steps you need to take in order to position yourself to be successful in this business.

Consider this my open invitation to sit down and talk about a career in real estate. All you have to do is call me, text me, or shoot me a quick email. I’d love to help you get started.

It’s now the first week of November, and with the election coming to an end in a couple of days, we’ll soon be able to get back to business.

One of the most important things you should be doing right now is planning your business for 2017. Yes, it’s still 2016 and you’re still putting deals together. There may be more commissions to be had in December, but you should be doing your business planning now. What worked for you in 2016? Where did most of your business come from? Go through every closed transaction from the both seller and buyer side to find out exactly where that business came from. You can eliminate the poorest performing advertising marketing strategies are, to eliminate them from the budget of 2017.

“One of the most important things you should be doing right now is planning your business for 2017.”

I would be happy to share our business plan for 2017. Simply shoot me a quick email or text message. If you would like to go over your business plan in better detail, give me a call. I’d love to sit down and create an approach for your real estate career in 2017.

If you’re anything like me, you may be overwhelmed by the number of apps and social media options available today. Obviously we’re all aware of Facebook, as it’s the most-used social media network, but Instagram has over 400 million users and Twitter has over 320 million users. Because Facebook users dwarf those numbers, you might be surprised to learn that both Twitter and Instagram are outperforming Facebook in usage.

If you’re not familiar with how to promote your team and your business through these two social media platforms, there are a ton of resources out there for you to look into. I highly recommend creating both a Twitter and an Instagram account in order to broaden your reach and get in front of more people.

“IF YOU’RE NOT INVOLVED WITH THESE GREAT APPS NOW, YOU’RE REALLY MISSING OUT.”

Another newer service is Snapchat. You may have heard of it due to its popularity among younger people, but there are some statistics I recently came across that blew my mind. There are about 100 million users on it, and right now, Snapchat ads are seen anywhere between 500,000 and one million times a day. What’s interesting about these ads is you know they are being viewed because people have to click on them when they appear if they want to view the next snap.

Today I wanted to expand a bit on a recurring theme that I often talk about: working as a team or building a team. I wanted to talk about my team a bit here. Even though I am the broker owner of Carbutti &amp; Company Real Estate and I have a lot of independent agents, I do run my own team within the the brokerage.

Two of the most important positions on a real estate team are a full-time licensed transaction coordinator and also a full-time ISA (inside sales agent). Right now, I have a full-time ISA who only makes outbound phone calls every single day, and sets appointments and face-to-face meetings for my buyer agents or listing specialists.

“AN ISA AND TRANSACTION COORDINATOR ARE THE TWO KEY HIRES FOR GROWTH.”

We also have a full-time transaction coordinator, and his only role is to handle transactions from contract to close for our agents. I really can’t downplay the role of a transaction coordinator on a team. He frees up our agents’ time to sell more properties by really managing all of those non-dollar-producing activities, like writing addendums, negotiation of home inspections issues, extending mortgage commitments, extending closing dates, communicating with paralegals and getting contracts over to the attorney. And that’s just the beginning of what he does.
All of these activities that take up an agent’s day really are distractions from doing what is most important - things we do that actually make us money. This includes feeding the front end, servicing clients, going on appointments, and preparing for listing appointments, among other things.

Whether your team consists of three people or 23 people, the ISA and the full-time transaction coordinator really are the two key hires for your real estate team. This is what will really propel you to the next level and let you have some explosive, exponential growth.

If you have any questions about setting up your team, or questions about how we set up our team, give me a call or shoot me a quick email. I’d love to get together and talk strategy and tactics.
