We all wait for the spring market every year, and this time it’s been disrupted. Remarkably, despite that, our team just experienced the busiest April we’ve had in three years, and we haven’t missed a beat. We’re doing some things a bit differently right now in regard to how we’re running our business.“Our team just experienced the busiest April we’ve had in three years.”Our new normal is meeting with clients virtually and having them sign documents via DocuSign. Some may see these changes as negatives, but I see the opposite. I love the way the real estate industry is going with this. Honestly, I want things to stay like this even after the health crisis abates; I enjoy doing everything electronically. We also have virtual home selling webinars every Thursday evening at 6:30. I can share my screen to show participants what I’m discussing and answer any questions they have.If any of you are considering a career in real estate, it’s not the time to put your plans on hold. This is the time to get into the real estate market because it’s alive and well. If you want to talk about your business with me, call or email any time. Also, reach out if you have any questions.

        "content": "If you’re on a real estate team like ours, you’re part of a well-oiled machine that helps everyone do more business. Here are just a few of the benefits of being on our team.On this edition of our agent training blog, we’re doing something a little bit different. I’m pulling into a house in Oxford on Holley Rd. that we just sold for $15,000 over asking price. The funny part is that right now is the first time I’m actually seeing the property in person.It’s a 3,200 square foot house with a separate, private, in-law entry door. I wanted to see the finished product, of course, but I also wanted to talk about the power of having a team around you that can help get homes like this sold for top dollar.This home is professionally staged, as you can see in the video above. It’s got a great kitchen, too. Staging shows buyers how a home should be lived in, and good staging shows off all the space available in bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.“If you’re not offering services like staging and photography, you’re at a competitive disadvantage.”Although it is possible to be a successful solo agent, most of the successful agents out there work as part of a team. The power of being on a team means you have more resources, accountability, and power in the marketplace. Instead of one person doing everything, each person does one thing at an expert level. For example, this property was leveraged, staged, and sold before I even got a chance to see it in person.If you’re not offering services like professional staging, photography, and everything else under the sun, you’re at a competitive disadvantage. It’s all about being relevant in the marketplace so you can get the business, win the listing, add to the buyer experience, and get the job done.If you are interested in talking about the services our team offers to our agents and how you can do more business on our team, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I’d love to hear from you.",

Here’s how.I’ve been in real estate for 22 years, and recently, I’ve enjoyed getting back to the basics of it all; I’ve been starting my days by focusing on mindset. Motivational podcasts have been a huge part of my intellectual diet, and some really good ones include Brian Buffini’s podcast and a program titled Real Estate Success Calls. Both have so much to offer newer agents. “Mindset molds how the rest of your day will go.”In the latter podcast, real-life agents talk about how they’ve been exactly where you are now in your real estate career and how they were able to take things to the next level—the methodology, the motivations, and every little thing in between. Just by getting your mind right in the morning by listening to these podcasts before starting your workday, you will see an exponential growth over time. Mindset molds how the rest of your day will go. If you would like to have an honest and vulnerable conversation about your real estate business, don’t hesitate to reach out to me by phone or email.

        "content": "Successful agents are accountable, and they also stick to a routine. Here’s how the top agents on our team do it.In order to take your career in real estate to the next level, you need to stay in a routine. It’s a simple concept, but as someone who has been in real estate for 22 years, one common thread among successful agents is accountability. Here at Carbutti &amp; Co., we really put a focus on achieving things together. It’s not just about one agent doing their own thing, although you can have success as an individual agent. However, there’s a certain power to working on a team in terms of mindshare, resources, and the power of controlling the saleable inventory.Everyone on our team understands their role. We have an inside sales department, a full-time social media manager, professional photographers, and more. “Everyone on our team has a specific role.”Real estate is all about dollar-producing activities and non-dollar-producing activities. I believe we’ve done a great job of training our agents on those dollar-producing activities and how best to execute them.If you have any questions for me about what we do, or if you’re interested in bringing your real estate career to the next level, don’t hesitate to reach out by giving me a call or sending an email.

Today you’ll find out why.Today I’d like to introduce you to one of the premier mortgage lenders in our area: Marc Meglio with HomeBridge Financial Services. We could give you a list of reasons why you should work with him, but we’ll let him tell you in his own words. What makes HomeBridge a cut above other lenders is they specialize in renovation financing on top of the traditional mortgage products. As he puts it, “I, myself, am different…because I go to a lot of open houses with Carbutti &amp; Co. Realtors…and they really appreciate that.” That’s not the only way Marc goes the extra mile: He’s present for all his clients’ closings as well. Because there are a lot of first-time buyers out there who might be nervous entering the process, he takes his role very seriously and looks to establish trust, confidence, and rapport. The team environment we foster also “creates an environment of success,” Marc says. We couldn’t agree more. If you have any questions for us or Marc or you need help with your home buying needs, please let Carbutti &amp; Co. Realtors know. We’d be happy to help!",

That why for today’s message, we brought on agent Devin Close to talk about her experience with us. Devin came to us as a recent college graduate, and when she learned more about what we’re all about, she knew that coming aboard with us was “a no-brainer.” Aside from the assistance we offer all of our new agents, Devin said one of the things she appreciates most about working for Carbutti Real Estate is that she didn’t have to drain her own bank account just to get off the ground and start making money. That’s because, compared to other brokerages, the fees we charge are very minimal. From the opportunities and resources we offer, Devin feels secure in her ability to pursue her personal and professional goals. As always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

The house behind me is actually the fourth referral that I’ve received from the same past client in the last 12 months. The reason I’m bringing this up is that I’ve seen many real estate gurus encourage new agents to buy internet leads or reach out to cold contacts. What I’ve found is most effective, however, is to cultivate your sphere of influence. Creating raving fans is what will allow you to get multiple referrals from the same past clients.If you want to know how to cultivate your sphere of influence, please give me a call or send me an email. We’re opening our second office on December 1, 2018, and we’d love for you to join our team.",

Success stories like the one I am going to share with you today.“GET STORIES LIKE THIS UNDER YOUR BELT SO CAN START TELLING THEM AND SHOW YOUR FUTURE CLIENTS YOUR PAST SUCCESSES.”Consultative approaches can be a great thing. When clients listen, everybody wins.My client is 74 years old and has owned his home for 36 years. Recently, he had a neighbor approach him about purchasing the home for $190,000. He considered the offer and actually almost sold his home to the neighbor.However, he met with our real estate team and we went through the home with him. We told him that he could sell it for that amount, but if he cleaned it out, painted it, and refinished the hardwood floors, he would get a lot more money.The client decided to listen to us. He had the place professionally cleaned and refinished the floors. It may have been a lot of work moving out the nine dumpsters’ worth of stuff from the upstairs, but within 48 hours we had 25 showings and were in a five-offer multiple offer situation. We ended up getting him $50,000 more than what the neighbor was offering.Get stories like this under your belt so you can start telling the stories, or have old clients tell your story to show future clients your success. There is nothing more powerful than social proof.If you are not using video or professional photography with the latest and greatest marketing, contact me by phone or email.

        "content": "Some really great real estate coaching is available for agents at every level of their careers. The key to getting the most from coaching is figuring out exactly where you are in your career and exactly where you want to be before committing to anyone.The real estate coaching business is a billion-dollar industry and there are all types of coaches. There are so many different levels of great coaches as well, whether you’re a brand-new agent, an experienced agent stuck at a certain level of production, or you are selling 30 to 40 homes a year and you want to create your own team and leverage yourself to sell more than 100 homes a year.I’ve coached with the “Red Hot Rookie” through Leader’s Edge, I’ve coached through Carla Cross and “On Track to Success in 30 Days System for Inexperienced Agents,” and I have all the CDs from Dirk Zeller’s Real Estate Champions. The list goes on and on.Before you choose a coaching program, you need to figure out exactly where you are in your real estate career and what you want to accomplish. You can have a real estate coach or even a prospecting coach. A prospecting coach will teach you what to say, how to say it, and the language behind the sales.The point is, before you jump in and commit to a six-month or one-year contract with a coach and pay out all this money, figure out exactly what you want to accomplish. I guarantee that if you figure out what your goals are, you can then find the right coach for you.“HAVE A CLEAR PICTURE OF YOUR GOALS BEFORE SIGNING A CONTRACT WITH A COACH.”Sometimes paying a coach isn’t even the right answer. It could be a matter of finding the right real estate broker, team leader, or broker-mentor. I like to think of myself as a broker-mentor to my team.If you’d like to sit down to talk about your goals and what the next level is for you, I’d be happy to sit down with you, because no one’s made more mistakes than I have! No one has spent more money on things that didn’t work and coaching that didn’t work than me.It all starts with figuring out your goals, then figuring out your level of commitment to the coaching. If you don’t have that level of commitment to do everything your coach asks you to do in a timely manner, then I guarantee you that the coaching won’t work.If this is a conversation you’d like to have, give me a call or shoot me an email today.

You won’t have enough deals if you don’t have enough leads or prospects.This audiobook will give you some real time tips on things you can implement in your business to convert more leads. They have a great 30-day rule, which is critical to keeping your pipeline full. Blount also discusses the Five C’s of Social Selling, how to get prospects to call you, and his five-step text messaging formula.I’ve been implementing some of these things and I have already gotten responses back.

I wanted to talk about my team a bit here. Even though I am the broker owner of Carbutti &amp; Company Real Estate and I have a lot of independent agents, I do run my own team within the the brokerage.Two of the most important positions on a real estate team are a full-time licensed transaction coordinator and also a full-time ISA (inside sales agent). Right now, I have a full-time ISA who only makes outbound phone calls every single day, and sets appointments and face-to-face meetings for my buyer agents or listing specialists.“AN ISA AND TRANSACTION COORDINATOR ARE THE TWO KEY HIRES FOR GROWTH.”We also have a full-time transaction coordinator, and his only role is to handle transactions from contract to close for our agents. I really can’t downplay the role of a transaction coordinator on a team. He frees up our agents’ time to sell more properties by really managing all of those non-dollar-producing activities, like writing addendums, negotiation of home inspections issues, extending mortgage commitments, extending closing dates, communicating with paralegals and getting contracts over to the attorney. And that’s just the beginning of what he does.All of these activities that take up an agent’s day really are distractions from doing what is most important - things we do that actually make us money. This includes feeding the front end, servicing clients, going on appointments, and preparing for listing appointments, among other things.Whether your team consists of three people or 23 people, the ISA and the full-time transaction coordinator really are the two key hires for your real estate team. This is what will really propel you to the next level and let you have some explosive, exponential growth.If you have any questions about setting up your team, or questions about how we set up our team, give me a call or shoot me a quick email. I’d love to get together and talk strategy and tactics.",
