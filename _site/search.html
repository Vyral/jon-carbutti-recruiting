        "content": "Here’s new agent Jonathon’s journey into real estate in his own words.My name is Jonathon Corriveau, and I chose a career in real estate because my daughter was an infant, so I wanted a career that would allow me to support her and make money working for myself and not someone else. I had a retail background; I worked at Best Buy and Firestone, and I was selling people plenty of things they didn’t need. I was a good salesman, but I wanted to sell people things they truly needed, so I thought real estate would be the right career for me. There are many naysayers when you try to get into a career in real estate, but what was crucial for me was finding that one person who told me to go for it, and I stayed around that person.“The day I got licensed, I went home and proposed to my girlfriend.”I received a call from Andrew, the sales manager at Carbutti and Co., and he wanted to sit down for an interview with me. We sat down for about two hours and discussed many topics at length, both about real estate and other matters. The atmosphere is what drew me to this team. The day I got licensed, I went home and proposed to my girlfriend, who is now my fiancée, so it was one of the best days of my life.Next, Andrew and Lisa, the vice president, helped me set fantastic goals that I want to knock out of the park. My personal goal is to ensure the health and welfare of my daughter and unborn son. My main professional goal is to be a respected agent in my brokerage and to my clients.If you have any questions about real estate or our team, please call or email us. We would love to speak with you.",

Today I want to talk about how our team has been growing and why working with a real estate team is often better than working as a solo agentWe now have a full-time employee, Lisa Holden, whose sole responsibility is to onboard all of our new agents and walk them through the onboarding process. She has been instrumental with our newest agents, some of whom (believe it or not) have been among our best agents.“There are clear benefits to working with a team.”One of our agents just wrote her fourth offer with a client very recently, and she has three sales pending. She has only been licensed for less than four months!Another agent, with Lisa’s help, just put his first sale pending together and is taking his first listing along the shoreline with an expired listing. The clients were super impressed with how prepared he was for that presentation and they realized right away that the Carbutti Real Estate Team was right for the job.The days of being a one-person show in real estate are not necessarily over, but working alone will put you at a disadvantage, especially if you’re a new agent. There are clear benefits to working with a team, such as back-end support, resources, and systems to promote success.If you’re looking for a real estate team to join, have been thinking of starting a career in real estate, or would like to talk about your approach to business and how it can improve, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

He likes being in disciplined environments, which came in handy for his career as a Realtor.When he decided to work in real estate, Jim was looking for a team environment, which is just what he got here at Carbutti Realtors. He didn’t see other brokerages offer the same kind of support that we do here.One of the hardest parts of getting involved with the business was getting on the phone to make cold calls. It’s not an easy process; he knew it would be hard work, but even still, he underestimated just how hard it would be. In the end, however, the support he received helped him boost his confidence. It took a few months for him to get the hang of it, but his hard work paid off.“Jim was looking for a team environment, which is just what he got here at Carbutti Realtors.”If you have any questions about what life is like for agents on the Carbutti Realtors Team, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.

        "category": "",
        "content": "The market is booming—but don’t get complacent, agents.Yes, the market is booming, and yes, houses are flying off the shelves. To some of the newer agents to the business, the real estate industry might almost seem easy—all they have to do is put a house on the market and they can sell it in a day. However, today I want to remind all of you that this is not a typical real estate market. That’s why now more than ever, it’s important for agents to get a good handle on the basics of real estate, including practicing scripts and dialogues, protecting your time, getting into a schedule, and learning the business.“This is not a typical real estate market.”When the market changes from being such a hot seller’s market to more of a buyer’s market where houses sit on the market for a lot longer than they are now, you’ll have to use different strategies to get the homes sold. That’s when your experience and your reference points are truly going to matter. The experienced agents who embrace consistency and protect their time are going to be the ones who thrive when the market changes.I have brand-new agents who are crushing it right now. One of my agents who was licensed in February already has five sales under his belt. Part of the reason that he’s doing so well is that he has access to great mentoring and coaching; if you’re new to the industry, you need to find a broker that fits your values and is willing to provide the support and coaching you need.If you’d like to discuss your strategies and business plan or you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

We live in the age of social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, which gives you many different avenues to help increase your fanbase.

Some may see these changes as negatives, but I see the opposite. I love the way the real estate industry is going with this. Honestly, I want things to stay like this even after the health crisis abates; I enjoy doing everything electronically. We also have virtual home selling webinars every Thursday evening at 6:30. I can share my screen to show participants what I’m discussing and answer any questions they have.If any of you are considering a career in real estate, it’s not the time to put your plans on hold.

Here are just a few of the benefits of being on our team.On this edition of our agent training blog, we’re doing something a little bit different. I’m pulling into a house in Oxford on Holley Rd. that we just sold for $15,000 over asking price. The funny part is that right now is the first time I’m actually seeing the property in person.It’s a 3,200 square foot house with a separate, private, in-law entry door. I wanted to see the finished product, of course, but I also wanted to talk about the power of having a team around you that can help get homes like this sold for top dollar.This home is professionally staged, as you can see in the video above. It’s got a great kitchen, too. Staging shows buyers how a home should be lived in, and good staging shows off all the space available in bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.“If you’re not offering services like staging and photography, you’re at a competitive disadvantage.”Although it is possible to be a successful solo agent, most of the successful agents out there work as part of a team. The power of being on a team means you have more resources, accountability, and power in the marketplace. Instead of one person doing everything, each person does one thing at an expert level. For example, this property was leveraged, staged, and sold before I even got a chance to see it in person.If you’re not offering services like professional staging, photography, and everything else under the sun, you’re at a competitive disadvantage. It’s all about being relevant in the marketplace so you can get the business, win the listing, add to the buyer experience, and get the job done.If you are interested in talking about the services our team offers to our agents and how you can do more business on our team, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email.

It’s a simple concept, but as someone who has been in real estate for 22 years, one common thread among successful agents is accountability. Here at Carbutti &amp; Co., we really put a focus on achieving things together. It’s not just about one agent doing their own thing, although you can have success as an individual agent. However, there’s a certain power to working on a team in terms of mindshare, resources, and the power of controlling the saleable inventory.Everyone on our team understands their role. We have an inside sales department, a full-time social media manager, professional photographers, and more. “Everyone on our team has a specific role.”Real estate is all about dollar-producing activities and non-dollar-producing activities. I believe we’ve done a great job of training our agents on those dollar-producing activities and how best to execute them.If you have any questions for me about what we do, or if you’re interested in bringing your real estate career to the next level, don’t hesitate to reach out by giving me a call or sending an email.

What makes HomeBridge a cut above other lenders is they specialize in renovation financing on top of the traditional mortgage products. As he puts it, “I, myself, am different…because I go to a lot of open houses with Carbutti &amp; Co. Realtors…and they really appreciate that.” That’s not the only way Marc goes the extra mile: He’s present for all his clients’ closings as well. Because there are a lot of first-time buyers out there who might be nervous entering the process, he takes his role very seriously and looks to establish trust, confidence, and rapport. The team environment we foster also “creates an environment of success,” Marc says. We couldn’t agree more.

When clients listen, everybody wins.My client is 74 years old and has owned his home for 36 years. Recently, he had a neighbor approach him about purchasing the home for $190,000. He considered the offer and actually almost sold his home to the neighbor.However, he met with our real estate team and we went through the home with him. We told him that he could sell it for that amount, but if he cleaned it out, painted it, and refinished the hardwood floors, he would get a lot more money.The client decided to listen to us. He had the place professionally cleaned and refinished the floors. It may have been a lot of work moving out the nine dumpsters’ worth of stuff from the upstairs, but within 48 hours we had 25 showings and were in a five-offer multiple offer situation. We ended up getting him $50,000 more than what the neighbor was offering.Get stories like this under your belt so you can start telling the stories, or have old clients tell your story to show future clients your success.

The key to getting the most from coaching is figuring out exactly where you are in your career and exactly where you want to be before committing to anyone.The real estate coaching business is a billion-dollar industry and there are all types of coaches. There are so many different levels of great coaches as well, whether you’re a brand-new agent, an experienced agent stuck at a certain level of production, or you are selling 30 to 40 homes a year and you want to create your own team and leverage yourself to sell more than 100 homes a year.I’ve coached with the “Red Hot Rookie” through Leader’s Edge, I’ve coached through Carla Cross and “On Track to Success in 30 Days System for Inexperienced Agents,” and I have all the CDs from Dirk Zeller’s Real Estate Champions. The list goes on and on.Before you choose a coaching program, you need to figure out exactly where you are in your real estate career and what you want to accomplish. You can have a real estate coach or even a prospecting coach. A prospecting coach will teach you what to say, how to say it, and the language behind the sales.The point is, before you jump in and commit to a six-month or one-year contract with a coach and pay out all this money, figure out exactly what you want to accomplish. I guarantee that if you figure out what your goals are, you can then find the right coach for you.“HAVE A CLEAR PICTURE OF YOUR GOALS BEFORE SIGNING A CONTRACT WITH A COACH.”Sometimes paying a coach isn’t even the right answer. It could be a matter of finding the right real estate broker, team leader, or broker-mentor. I like to think of myself as a broker-mentor to my team.If you’d like to sit down to talk about your goals and what the next level is for you, I’d be happy to sit down with you, because no one’s made more mistakes than I have! No one has spent more money on things that didn’t work and coaching that didn’t work than me.It all starts with figuring out your goals, then figuring out your level of commitment to the coaching. If you don’t have that level of commitment to do everything your coach asks you to do in a timely manner, then I guarantee you that the coaching won’t work.If this is a conversation you’d like to have, give me a call or shoot me an email today.

Where did most of your business come from? Go through every closed transaction from the both seller and buyer side to find out exactly where that business came from. You can eliminate the poorest performing advertising marketing strategies are, to eliminate them from the budget of 2017.“One of the most important things you should be doing right now is planning your business for 2017.”I would be happy to share our business plan for 2017.

Obviously we’re all aware of Facebook, as it’s the most-used social media network, but Instagram has over 400 million users and Twitter has over 320 million users. Because Facebook users dwarf those numbers, you might be surprised to learn that both Twitter and Instagram are outperforming Facebook in usage.If you’re not familiar with how to promote your team and your business through these two social media platforms, there are a ton of resources out there for you to look into. I highly recommend creating both a Twitter and an Instagram account in order to broaden your reach and get in front of more people.“IF YOU’RE NOT INVOLVED WITH THESE GREAT APPS NOW, YOU’RE REALLY MISSING OUT.”Another newer service is Snapchat. You may have heard of it due to its popularity among younger people, but there are some statistics I recently came across that blew my mind. There are about 100 million users on it, and right now, Snapchat ads are seen anywhere between 500,000 and one million times a day. What’s interesting about these ads is you know they are being viewed because people have to click on them when they appear if they want to view the next snap.If you’re not getting involved with these apps now on the ground floor, you’re really missing out. I’m going to be doing some really interesting things with Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter, and I would like to see what you’re doing as well. If you would like to collaborate or if you have any questions about what we’re going to be doing, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would love to strategize with you!",

If you’d liketo learn more about working with Carbutti &amp; Co. Realtors, contact meat (203) 269-4910 or Jonathan@Carbutti.com.Today I wanted to expand a bit on a recurring theme that I often talk about: working as a team or building a team. I wanted to talk about my team a bit here. Even though I am the broker owner of Carbutti &amp; Company Real Estate and I have a lot of independent agents, I do run my own team within the the brokerage.Two of the most important positions on a real estate team are a full-time licensed transaction coordinator and also a full-time ISA (inside sales agent). Right now, I have a full-time ISA who only makes outbound phone calls every single day, and sets appointments and face-to-face meetings for my buyer agents or listing specialists.“AN ISA AND TRANSACTION COORDINATOR ARE THE TWO KEY HIRES FOR GROWTH.”We also have a full-time transaction coordinator, and his only role is to handle transactions from contract to close for our agents. I really can’t downplay the role of a transaction coordinator on a team. He frees up our agents’ time to sell more properties by really managing all of those non-dollar-producing activities, like writing addendums, negotiation of home inspections issues, extending mortgage commitments, extending closing dates, communicating with paralegals and getting contracts over to the attorney. And that’s just the beginning of what he does.All of these activities that take up an agent’s day really are distractions from doing what is most important - things we do that actually make us money. This includes feeding the front end, servicing clients, going on appointments, and preparing for listing appointments, among other things.Whether your team consists of three people or 23 people, the ISA and the full-time transaction coordinator really are the two key hires for your real estate team. This is what will really propel you to the next level and let you have some explosive, exponential growth.If you have any questions about setting up your team, or questions about how we set up our team, give me a call or shoot me a quick email. I’d love to get together and talk strategy and tactics.",
