        <title>The Importance of Marketing in a Successful Real Estate Business</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/j3xY32TB8g0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A career in the real estate business is also a career in the marketing business. Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re almost into 2020, but before we get there, I have a message for you. Everybody wants to get into the real estate business, but if you’re getting into the real estate business right now, you’re actually getting into the marketing business as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, when you’re thinking about a career in real estate, you’re entering one of the most competitive businesses out there. This means that you don’t want to look like everyone else.
You want to stand out from the crowd. The best way to stand out is through your marketing. Whether it’s through radio, TV, advertising, social media, you have got to look different than every other agent and you’ve got to make an impression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=You want to stand out from the crowd in this business.%20http://localhost:4000/the-importance-of-marketing-in.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“You want to stand out from the crowd in this business.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here at Carbutti and Co., we’re committed to having a social media manager, along with different marketing strategies and value propositions. If you’re thinking about a career in real estate and you don’t want to go it alone, give us a call or send us an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Interviewing Marc Meglio From HomeBridge Financial Services</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/C6kEmMruDGo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We point many of our buyer clients in the direction of local lender Marc Meglio with HomeBridge Financial Services. Today you’ll find out why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’d like to introduce you to one of the premier mortgage lenders in our area: Marc Meglio with HomeBridge Financial Services. We could give you a list of reasons why you should work with him, but we’ll let him tell you in his own words. What makes HomeBridge a cut above other lenders is they specialize in renovation financing on top of the traditional mortgage products. As he puts it, “I, myself, am different…because I go to a lot of open houses with Carbutti &amp;amp; Co. Realtors…and they really appreciate that.” That’s not the only way Marc goes the extra mile: He’s present for all his clients’ closings as well. Because there are a lot of first-time buyers out there who might be nervous entering the process, he takes his role very seriously and looks to establish trust, confidence, and rapport. The team environment we foster also “creates an environment of success,” Marc says. We couldn’t agree more. If you have any questions for us or Marc or you need help with your home buying needs, please let Carbutti &amp;amp; Co. Realtors know. We’d be happy to help!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Introducing 1 of Our Great Team Members: Devin Close</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cdKwPmXjvwI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever been curious about what being a part of Carbutti Real Estate is like, today’s your chance to hear it straight from one of our agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could go on and on about the reasons agents love being a part of our team here at Carbutti Real Estate, but we think it’s best to let them tell you in their own words. That why for today’s message, we brought on agent Devin Close to talk about her experience with us. Devin came to us as a recent college graduate, and when she learned more about what we’re all about, she knew that coming aboard with us was “a no-brainer.” Aside from the assistance we offer all of our new agents, Devin said one of the things she appreciates most about working for Carbutti Real Estate is that she didn’t have to drain her own bank account just to get off the ground and start making money. That’s because, compared to other brokerages, the fees we charge are very minimal. From the opportunities and resources we offer, Devin feels secure in her ability to pursue her personal and professional goals. As always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How We Plan to Help New Agents This Year</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0_og1IrdIms?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Carbutti &amp;amp; Co. Real Estate, our goal for 2019 is to help agents work smarter—not harder.
A lot of agents understand the difference between dollar-producing and non dollar-producing activities,
but correctly allocating one’s focus between these two kinds of tasks can be easier said than done.
That’s why we offer full-time real estate coaching for new agents. We want to take those just entering
the business and help get them into production as soon as possible. So if you’re interested in being a
part of our mentorship program, get in touch with us. To learn more about this opportunity, watch this
short video.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>We Have a New Office. Now We Need New Agents</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MBnpM1IXTxE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to announce the opening of the 2nd Carbutti Realtors office
right here in downtown Branford, CT. (707 Main St.) and a short walk from
the town green. We’re beautifully renovating a great first-floor space to make
this an office of the future for the agents here along the shoreline.
We will be open for business as of December 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, we’re looking for five to 10 brand-new team members to
join us. If you’re interested in increasing your business in 2019 and learning
a new, different, and more productive way of doing real estate, give me a call
or send me an email today so we can set up a confidential interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Importance of Referrals</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/CbmZkLQsrQk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we’ll be discussing the best technique for getting referrals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I wanted to speak to some of the newer agents in the marketplace about the importance of referrals. The house behind me is actually the fourth referral that I’ve received from the same past client in the last 12 months. The reason I’m bringing this up is that I’ve seen many real estate gurus encourage new agents to buy internet leads or reach out to cold contacts. What I’ve found is most effective, however, is to cultivate your sphere of influence. Creating raving fans is what will allow you to get multiple referrals from the same past clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know how to cultivate your sphere of influence, please give me a call or send me an email. We’re opening our second office on December 1, 2018, and we’d love for you to join our team.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Success Story Worth $50,000</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-m9tuwBmnFo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get stories like this under your belt so can start telling them and show your future clients your past successes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes me really proud to be in the real estate industry? Success stories like the one I am going to share with you today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=GET STORIES LIKE THIS UNDER YOUR BELT SO CAN START TELLING THEM AND SHOW YOUR FUTURE CLIENTS YOUR PAST SUCCESSES.%20http://localhost:4000/a-success-story-worth-50000.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“GET STORIES LIKE THIS UNDER YOUR BELT SO CAN START TELLING THEM AND SHOW YOUR FUTURE CLIENTS YOUR PAST SUCCESSES.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consultative approaches can be a great thing. When clients listen, everybody wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My client is 74 years old and has owned his home for 36 years. Recently, he had a neighbor approach him about purchasing the home for $190,000. He considered the offer and actually almost sold his home to the neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, he met with our real estate team and we went through the home with him. We told him that he could sell it for that amount, but if he cleaned it out, painted it, and refinished the hardwood floors, he would get a lot more money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The client decided to listen to us. He had the place professionally cleaned and refinished the floors. It may have been a lot of work moving out the nine dumpsters’ worth of stuff from the upstairs, but within 48 hours we had 25 showings and were in a five-offer multiple offer situation. We ended up getting him $50,000 more than what the neighbor was offering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get stories like this under your belt so you can start telling the stories, or have old clients tell your story to show future clients your success. There is nothing more powerful than social proof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not using video or professional photography with the latest and greatest marketing, contact me by phone or email. I would be happy to speak with you about moving from being an amateur to a professional. It is time for you to go pro.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Value of Reading The Resilience Roadmap by Danny Morel </title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/a2IaxLYzvzI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Resilience Roadmap” by Danny Morel is a book that can help you reach the level of success you desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never heard of or haven’t read the book “The Resilience Roadmap” by Danny Morel, I highly recommend that you read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think there’s another real estate agent or broker in the business who’s gone through more trials and tribulations than Danny to get where he is today. I also think there’s not another person who’s more involved on a daily basis in his agents’ success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=YOUR SUCCESS IS BASED ON YOUR ROUTINE.%20http://localhost:4000/the-value-of-reading-resilience-roadmap.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“YOUR SUCCESS IS BASED ON YOUR ROUTINE.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Resilience Roadmap” challenges you look at your mindset and your daily activity and make a routine for success. What he argues (and I agree with) is your success is based on your routine. If you don’t have a daily routine of doing the exact same things every day, practicing your skill sets, and getting better every day, you won’t reach the level of success you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love to hear your thoughts on this book, so feel free to text me or send me an email about it. If you have any other questions, I invite you to reach out to me as well. I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;
