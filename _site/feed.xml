        <title>Q: What’s Our New Normal?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9-7ghMSRtac?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ve made changes to continue helping our clients amid COVID-19.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last few weeks have been difficult because of the global pandemic and what’s going on in the real estate market. We all wait for the spring market every year, and this time it’s been disrupted. Remarkably, despite that, our team just experienced the busiest April we’ve had in three years, and we haven’t missed a beat. We’re doing some things a bit differently right now in regard to how we’re running our business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Our team just experienced the busiest April we’ve had in three years.%20http://localhost:4000/q-whats-our-new-normal.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Our team just experienced the busiest April we’ve had in three years.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our new normal is meeting with clients virtually&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and having them sign documents via DocuSign.&lt;/strong&gt; Some may see these changes as negatives, but I see the opposite. I love the way the real estate industry is going with this. Honestly, I want things to stay like this even after the health crisis abates; I enjoy doing everything electronically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have virtual home selling webinars every Thursday evening at 6:30. I can share my screen to show participants what I’m discussing and answer any questions they have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of you are considering a career in real estate, it’s not the time to put your plans on hold. This is the time to get into the real estate market because it’s alive and well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to talk about your business with me, call or email any time. Also, reach out if you have any questions. I would love to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>An Example of What Working on a Great Team Gives You</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cS9A9reM58g?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re on a real estate team like ours, you’re part of a well-oiled machine that helps everyone do more business. Here are just a few of the benefits of being on our team.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this edition of our agent training blog, we’re doing something a little bit different. I’m pulling into a house in Oxford on Holley Rd. that we just sold for $15,000 over asking price. &lt;strong&gt;The funny part is that right now is the first time I’m actually seeing the property in person.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a 3,200 square foot house with a separate, private, in-law entry door. I wanted to see the finished product, of course, but I also wanted to talk about the power of having a team around you that can help get homes like this sold for top dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This home is professionally staged, as you can see in the video above.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s got a great kitchen, too. Staging shows buyers how a home should be lived in, and good staging shows off all the space available in bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If you’re not offering services like staging and photography, you’re at a competitive disadvantage.%20http://localhost:4000/an-example-of-what-working-on-a-great-team-gives-you.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If you’re not offering services like staging and photography, you’re at a competitive disadvantage.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it is possible to be a successful solo agent, most of the successful agents out there work as part of a team. &lt;strong&gt;The power of being on a team means you have more resources, accountability, and power in the marketplace.&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of one person doing everything, each person does one thing at an expert level. For example, this property was leveraged, staged, and sold before I even got a chance to see it in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not offering services like professional staging, photography, and everything else under the sun, you’re at a competitive disadvantage. It’s all about being relevant in the marketplace so you can get the business, win the listing, add to the buyer experience, and get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in talking about the services our team offers to our agents and how you can do more business on our team, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I’d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mindset, Methodology, and Motivation</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nDicRRQbsZU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Listening to practical and motivating podcasts in the morning can make a difference. Here’s how.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been in real estate for 22 years, and recently, I’ve enjoyed getting back to the basics of it all; &lt;strong&gt;I’ve been starting my days by focusing on mindset.&lt;/strong&gt; Motivational podcasts have been a huge part of my intellectual diet, and some really good ones include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebrianbuffinishow.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brian Buffini’s podcast&lt;/a&gt; and a program titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/real-estate-agent-success-calls-mike-iGZpuElVcfX/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Real Estate Success Calls&lt;/a&gt;. Both have so much to offer newer agents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Mindset molds how the rest of your day will go.%20http://localhost:4000/mindset-methodology-and-motivation.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Mindset molds how the rest of your day will go.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the latter podcast, real-life agents talk about how they’ve been exactly where you are now in your real estate career and how they were able to take things to the next level—the methodology, the motivations, and every little thing in between. &lt;strong&gt;Just by getting your mind right in the morning by listening to these podcasts before starting your workday, you will see an exponential growth over time.&lt;/strong&gt; Mindset molds how the rest of your day will go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to have an honest and vulnerable conversation about your real estate business, don’t hesitate to reach out to me by phone or email. I’d love to hear from you and discuss how to make the leap from amateur to pro.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Staying in a Routine Is Essential to Real Estate Success</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/rQhRe2EL8YM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Successful agents are accountable, and they also stick to a routine. Here’s how the top agents on our team do it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to take your career in real estate to the next level, you need to stay in a routine. It’s a simple concept, but as someone who has been in real estate for 22 years, &lt;strong&gt;one common thread among successful agents is accountability. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here at Carbutti &amp;amp; Co., we really put a focus on achieving things together. It’s not just about one agent doing their own thing, although you can have success as an individual agent. However, &lt;strong&gt;there’s a certain power to working on a team in terms of mindshare, resources, and the power of controlling the saleable inventory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone on our team understands their role. We have an inside sales department, a full-time social media manager, professional photographers, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Everyone on our team has a specific role.%20http://localhost:4000/why-staying-in-a-routine-is-essential-to-real-estate-success.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Everyone on our team has a specific role.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real estate is all about dollar-producing activities and non-dollar-producing activities. I believe &lt;strong&gt;we’ve done a great job of training our agents on those dollar-producing activities and how best to execute them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me about what we do, or if you’re interested in bringing your real estate career to the next level, don’t hesitate to reach out by giving me a call or sending an email. I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Importance of Marketing in a Successful Real Estate Business</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/j3xY32TB8g0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A career in the real estate business is also a career in the marketing business. Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re almost into 2020, but before we get there, I have a message for you. Everybody wants to get into the real estate business, but if you’re getting into the real estate business right now, you’re actually getting into the marketing business as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, when you’re thinking about a career in real estate, you’re entering one of the most competitive businesses out there. This means that you don’t want to look like everyone else.
You want to stand out from the crowd. The best way to stand out is through your marketing. Whether it’s through radio, TV, advertising, social media, you have got to look different than every other agent and you’ve got to make an impression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=You want to stand out from the crowd in this business.%20http://localhost:4000/the-importance-of-marketing-in.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“You want to stand out from the crowd in this business.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here at Carbutti and Co., we’re committed to having a social media manager, along with different marketing strategies and value propositions. If you’re thinking about a career in real estate and you don’t want to go it alone, give us a call or send us an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Interviewing Marc Meglio From HomeBridge Financial Services</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/C6kEmMruDGo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We point many of our buyer clients in the direction of local lender Marc Meglio with HomeBridge Financial Services. Today you’ll find out why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’d like to introduce you to one of the premier mortgage lenders in our area: Marc Meglio with HomeBridge Financial Services. We could give you a list of reasons why you should work with him, but we’ll let him tell you in his own words. What makes HomeBridge a cut above other lenders is they specialize in renovation financing on top of the traditional mortgage products. As he puts it, “I, myself, am different…because I go to a lot of open houses with Carbutti &amp;amp; Co. Realtors…and they really appreciate that.” That’s not the only way Marc goes the extra mile: He’s present for all his clients’ closings as well. Because there are a lot of first-time buyers out there who might be nervous entering the process, he takes his role very seriously and looks to establish trust, confidence, and rapport. The team environment we foster also “creates an environment of success,” Marc says. We couldn’t agree more. If you have any questions for us or Marc or you need help with your home buying needs, please let Carbutti &amp;amp; Co. Realtors know. We’d be happy to help!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Introducing 1 of Our Great Team Members: Devin Close</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cdKwPmXjvwI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever been curious about what being a part of Carbutti Real Estate is like, today’s your chance to hear it straight from one of our agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could go on and on about the reasons agents love being a part of our team here at Carbutti Real Estate, but we think it’s best to let them tell you in their own words. That why for today’s message, we brought on agent Devin Close to talk about her experience with us. Devin came to us as a recent college graduate, and when she learned more about what we’re all about, she knew that coming aboard with us was “a no-brainer.” Aside from the assistance we offer all of our new agents, Devin said one of the things she appreciates most about working for Carbutti Real Estate is that she didn’t have to drain her own bank account just to get off the ground and start making money. That’s because, compared to other brokerages, the fees we charge are very minimal. From the opportunities and resources we offer, Devin feels secure in her ability to pursue her personal and professional goals. As always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How We Plan to Help New Agents This Year</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0_og1IrdIms?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Carbutti &amp;amp; Co. Real Estate, our goal for 2019 is to help agents work smarter—not harder.
A lot of agents understand the difference between dollar-producing and non dollar-producing activities,
but correctly allocating one’s focus between these two kinds of tasks can be easier said than done.
That’s why we offer full-time real estate coaching for new agents. We want to take those just entering
the business and help get them into production as soon as possible. So if you’re interested in being a
part of our mentorship program, get in touch with us. To learn more about this opportunity, watch this
short video.&lt;/p&gt;
