If you’re on a real estate team like ours, you’re part of a well-oiled machine that helps everyone do more business. Here are just a few of the benefits of being on our team.

On this edition of our agent training blog, we’re doing something a little bit different. I’m pulling into a house in Oxford on Holley Rd. that we just sold for $15,000 over asking price. **The ironic part is that right now is the first time I’m actually seeing the property in person.**

It’s a 3,200 square foot house with a separate, private, in-law entry door. I wanted to see the finished product, of course, but I also wanted to talk about the power of having a team around you that can help get homes like this sold for top dollar.

**This home is professionally staged, as you can see in the video above.** It’s got a great kitchen, too. Staging shows buyers how a home should be lived in, and good staging shows off all the space available in bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.

Although it is possible to be a successful solo agent, most of the successful agents out there work as part of a team. **The power of being on a team means you have more resources, more accountability, and more power in the marketplace.** Instead of one person doing everything, each person does one thing at an expert level. For example, this property was leveraged, staged, and sold before I even got a chance to see it in person.

If you're not offering services like professional staging, photography, and everything else under the sun, you’re at a competitive disadvantage. It’s all about being relevant in the marketplace so you can get the business, win the listing, add to the buyer experience, and get the job done.

If you are interested in sitting down to talk about the services our team offers to our agents and how you can do more business on our team, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I’d love to hear from you.
